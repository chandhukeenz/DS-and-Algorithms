//Merge Without Extra Space
//Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of sizes N and M in non-decreasing order. Merge them in sorted order without using any extra space. Modify arr1 so that it contains the first N elements and modify arr2 so that it contains the last M elements. 
 
//Example 1:

//Input: 
//N = 4, arr1[] = [1 3 5 7] 
//M = 5, arr2[] = [0 2 6 8 9]
//Output: 
//arr1[] = [0 1 2 3]
//arr2[] = [5 6 7 8 9]
//Explanation: After merging the two 
//non-decreasing arrays, we get, 
//0 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9.
