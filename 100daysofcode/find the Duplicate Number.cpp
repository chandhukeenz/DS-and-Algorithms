//Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

//There is only one duplicate number in nums, return this duplicate number.

//Follow-ups:

//How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums? 
//Can you solve the problem without modifying the array nums?
//Can you solve the problem using only constant, O(1) extra space?
//Can you solve the problem with runtime complexity less than O(n2)?

// 1(s)(f) 3 4 2 2
//take slow and fast pointer to traverse through the array using linked list concept (slow moves by 1, fast moves by 2)
//stop when the slow and fast pointer meet each other
//restart the fast pointer to its first pos.Now move the slow and fast pointer in the same speed.
//Now the collision point of slow and fast pointer becomes the duplicate number in the array
